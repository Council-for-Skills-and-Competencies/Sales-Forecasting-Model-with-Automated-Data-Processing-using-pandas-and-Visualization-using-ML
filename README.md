# EPBL Project Report – Machine Learning Based EV Sales Forecasting

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on building an **intelligent forecasting system** for predicting **Electric Vehicle (EV) sales** using **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)** techniques. With the global rise of sustainable transportation, accurate forecasting plays a key role in shaping **business strategies, policies, and investments**.

##  Objectives

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical EV sales data.
* Build an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network** for time-series forecasting (2024–2030).
* Develop an **interactive dashboard** using **Streamlit + Plotly** for real-time insights.
* Support decision-making through clear, dynamic, and region-specific visualizations.

##  Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly
* **Dashboard:** Streamlit (with custom CSS for UI)
* **Dataset Source:** International Energy Agency (IEA) – Global EV Sales Data

##  System Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering using `MinMaxScaler`.
2. **Model Building** – LSTM trained with historical EV sales data.
3. **Visualization** – Interactive graphs (line, bar, pie charts) for YoY growth, regional share, and future trends.
4. **Deployment** – Streamlit web app with dynamic filters, metrics, and downloadable insights.

##  Key Results

* Forecasted EV sales growth **from 2024 to 2030** with high accuracy.
* Projected **global EV sales > 17 million by 2030**.
* Provided **region-wise market share analysis** (China, Europe, North America leading).
* Delivered a **user-friendly dashboard** for policymakers, businesses, and researchers.

##  Impact

This project bridges **data science and sustainability** by enabling organizations to:

* Plan infrastructure for EV adoption.
* Forecast demand to optimize supply chains.
* Support policy frameworks for green mobility.
